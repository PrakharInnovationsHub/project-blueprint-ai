🏗️ Generalized Prompt — System Architecture Diagram

Prompt:
Create a system architecture diagram for a web-based application.
Include and label the following components clearly:

Frontend Layer: Handles user interface and client-side logic (e.g., React, Angular, or Vue).

Backend Layer: Processes requests, applies business logic, and communicates with the database (e.g., Node.js, Django, or Spring Boot).

Database Layer: Stores user data, application data, and logs (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL).

Authentication Module: Manages user login, registration, and access control (e.g., JWT or OAuth).

External Services / APIs: For notifications, analytics, or third-party integrations.

Hosting / Cloud Infrastructure: Depict deployment on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

Show clear data flow between layers using arrows — for example:

Frontend ↔ Backend via REST or GraphQL API

Backend ↔ Database for data storage and retrieval

Backend ↔ External services for notifications or integrations

Structure the diagram into layers (UI, API, Data, Services) and show logical relationships among all components.
