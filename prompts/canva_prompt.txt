Create a professional, modern, and minimalist logo for TaskWise, a team task and collaboration manager.
Use clean, tech-forward typography.
Include an abstract icon that symbolizes task management, productivity, and teamwork—such as interconnected nodes, checklists, or converging shapes.
Use a professional color palette that conveys efficiency, trust, and innovation (e.g., blue, green, gray accents).
Ensure the logo is flat, scalable, and works for both digital platforms (apps, web, social media) and print media.
Optionally, include a subtle symbol that hints at real-time collaboration or progress tracking.
