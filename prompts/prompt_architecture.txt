System Architecture Diagram (for TaskWise)
Prompt:
Create a system architecture diagram for a web-based task and collaboration management application called TaskWise.
 The system includes:
Frontend: React.js (web client) with responsive UI for task creation, assignment, and dashboards.


Backend: Node.js with Express.js REST API handling task management, authentication, and data communication.


Database: MongoDB storing users, projects, tasks, comments, and activity logs.


Authentication Module: JWT-based user login and role-based access control (admin, member).


Notifications Service: Sends real-time updates and email/push notifications for task status or deadlines.


Optional Integration: Google OAuth for quick sign-in.


Hosting Environment: Deployed on cloud (e.g., AWS or Render) with separate frontend and backend servers.


Connections:


Frontend communicates with backend via REST API


Backend connects to database and notification service


Authentication verifies tokens on every protected route


Dashboard fetches analytics from backend


Display components clearly: user interface layer, API layer, database layer, and external services. Use arrows to show data flow between components.
